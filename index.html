		 Hello! I'm currently working on my personal video game project, Fodder for the Elder Gods. 
	       </p>
      <p>My main goals are to eventually complete my personal project and learn more about game development and software engineering. 
	    I love watching my programming projects adapt and change as I work on them and I like seeing how they evolve as my own skills
	    evolve alongside them.</p>
      <p>I love to learn and am open to trying new things!</p>
