		 Hi! My name is Molly Hutchinson! Sometimes I do some game dev on the sides. I'm still learning, but it's fun to start with a
		 small idea and  watch it grow into something that you can play and test around on. Right now I'm working on two games,
		 one is a Gameboy game called Apollyon of Blue Room (not the final name) and the other is a game developed in
		 GameMaker Studio 2 and is called Fodder for the Elder Gods. I'm also in the process of planning another game,
		 which is untitled as of right now.

      <p> Apollyon of Blue Room deals with feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression along with not feeling like yourself anymore.</p>
      <p> Fodder for the Elder Gods is a farming game along the lines of Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon but with a focus on
	aliens and the unknown. You play as an alien that moved to the new planet to spite his family. </p>
